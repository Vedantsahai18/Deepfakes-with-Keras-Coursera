# Deepfakes-with-Keras-Coursera

Through this project, I learned to implement DCGAN or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network and trained the network to generate realistic-looking synthesized images. The term Deepfake is typically associated with synthetic data generated by Neural Networks which is similar to real-world, observed data - often with synthesized images, videos, or audio. Through this hands-on project, I went through the details of how such a network is structured, trained, and will ultimately generate synthetic images similar to hand-written digit 0 from the MNIST datasets. It needed me to have a theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, Convolution Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent. Focusing on the practical aspect of implementing and training DCGAN, but not too much on the theoretical aspect and with prior experience in Python programming.
